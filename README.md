# Coin Panic
 Simple Colnsole Text Game - Collect as many coins as possible in 100 moves

I was showing my son https://chat.openai.com/chat and he asked the AI to create a game. The I generated some code and then I took that code and used it as the foundation for this game. 

## Object of the Game
* Select the number of moves 
* See how many "C"oins the "P"layer can pick up navigating around the text board. 

## Game Play
```

[W] = Up, [A] = Left, [S] = Right, [D] = Down to move.
